# An Ultimate Tutorial for DJI Robomaster S1 Beginners

The RoboMaster S1 is an educational robot that provides users with an in-depth understanding of science, math, physics, programming, and more through captivating gameplay modes and intelligent features.


## Features


- Support for Python and Scratch programming language
- 46 Programmable Components - all in DIY mode
- 6 Programmable AI Module
- Low-latency HD FPV
- Scratch & Python Coding
- 4WD Omnidirectional Movement
- Intelligent Sensing Armor
- Multiple Exciting Battle Modes
- Innovative Hands-On Learning
- Two shooting methods: gel beads and infrared beams.
- Supports the official programming platform provided in the RoboMaster app known as RoboMaster Lab. 
- This feature is available on mobile devices and computers. You can program, connect, and operate the S1 directly when using RoboMaster Lab.
- Many parts of the S1 can be accessed and controlled through programming, including 7 motors, 6 hit detectors, 7 infrared sensors, 21 LED lights, 1 vision sensor, 1 microphone, 1 speaker, and 2 gyroscopes.
- With a microSD card inserted, the S1 can capture photos and record 1080p videos; without a microSD card, it supports only 720p.
- Photos taken by the S1 will be stored on the microSD card (when one is inserted). You can download them to your local device or share them directly to social media. For photos on the microSD card, you can remove the card and use an external device to export.
- Users can record and store video using the RoboMaster app. However, if operating without a microSD card, 720p is the only resolution option. When using a microSD card, users can record in 1080p, although it should be noted that playback within the app will still be displayed in 720p. The 1080p version will be stored on the microSD card and can be exported using an external device.
- The S1 has six PWM ports, which support servos, LEDs, drivers, and more. For more information on supported accessories, please visit programming guide.
- The battery of the S1 can last for 35 minutes of continuous use. This was measured with the S1 moving at a constant speed of 2.0m/s on a flat surface. The battery life on standby is about 100 minutes.
- The maximum forward speed is 3.5m/s, the maximum backward speed is 2.5m/s, and the maximum speed when moving sideways is 2.8m/s.


## Stimulus that S1 recognise

- Clapping Recognition: the S1 can recognize two or three consecutive claps and be programmed to execute custom responses.
- Gesture Recognition: the S1 can detect human gestures such as hand or arm signals and be programmed to execute custom responses.
- S1 Robot Recognition: the S1 can detect other RoboMaster S1 units.
- Vision Marker Recognition: the S1 can identify 44 kinds of official Vision Markers, which are comprised primarily of numbers, letters, and special characters. All of the files for these Vision Markers can be downloaded at insert web address.
- Line Recognition: the S1 can detect and follow blue, red, and green tracks with a width of approximately 15-25 mm.


## How it works?

- The RoboMaster S1 can be operated using a computer or a smart device via the touchscreen and gamepad. When using the gamepad with a touchscreen device, the robot can also be operated using an external mouse, which can be connected through a dedicated USB port
- Users can connect to the RoboMaster S1 via Wi-Fi or a router. When connecting via Wi-Fi, your mobile device or computer connects to the Wi-Fi of the S1. Connection via router provides broader signal coverage, which allows multiple control methods for robots to operate simultaneously on the same network.
- Flat surfaces such as wood, carpet, tile, and concrete are optimal for operating the S1. Users should avoid surfaces that are too smooth as the S1 wheels may have problems gaining enough traction for precise control. Surfaces with fine particles like sand or dirt should be avoided.

# An Ultimate Tutorial for DJI Robomaster S1 Beginners

The RoboMaster S1 is an educational robot that provides users with an in-depth understanding of science, math, physics, programming, and more through captivating gameplay modes and intelligent features.


## Top 10 Features


- Support for Python and Scratch programming language
- 46 Programmable Components - all in DIY mode
- 6 Programmable AI Module
- Low-latency HD FPV
- Scratch & Python Coding
- 4WD Omnidirectional Movement
- Intelligent Sensing Armor
- Multiple Exciting Battle Modes
- Innovative Hands-On Learning
- Two shooting methods: gel beads and infrared beams.
- Capability to capture photos and record 1080p videos; without a microSD card, it supports only 720p.



## Stimulus that S1 recognise

- Clapping Recognition: the S1 can recognize two or three consecutive claps and be programmed to execute custom responses.
- Gesture Recognition: the S1 can detect human gestures such as hand or arm signals and be programmed to execute custom responses.
- S1 Robot Recognition: the S1 can detect other RoboMaster S1 units.
- Vision Marker Recognition: the S1 can identify 44 kinds of official Vision Markers, which are comprised primarily of numbers, letters, and special characters. All of the files for these Vision Markers can be downloaded at insert web address.
- Line Recognition: the S1 can detect and follow blue, red, and green tracks with a width of approximately 15-25 mm.


## How it works?

- The RoboMaster S1 can be operated using a computer or a smart device via the touchscreen and gamepad. When using the gamepad with a touchscreen device, the robot can also be operated using an external mouse, which can be connected through a dedicated USB port
- Users can connect to the RoboMaster S1 via Wi-Fi or a router. When connecting via Wi-Fi, your mobile device or computer connects to the Wi-Fi of the S1. Connection via router provides broader signal coverage, which allows multiple control methods for robots to operate simultaneously on the same network.
- Flat surfaces such as wood, carpet, tile, and concrete are optimal for operating the S1. Users should avoid surfaces that are too smooth as the S1 wheels may have problems gaining enough traction for precise control. Surfaces with fine particles like sand or dirt should be avoided.
